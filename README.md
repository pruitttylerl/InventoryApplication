SNHU Inventory Application CS-360

Opens to a login screen for username and passord. The user can navigate to a notification settings screen, register login information, or submitting existing login attempts. Upon successful login attempt, 10 items will be viewable and the rest are accessible by swiping up or down. Tapping on an item pulls up an individual view of the item details. From this view, upon clicking an edit or delete button, the user can modify the item or remove it respectively.


    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This application was required to be an inventory application with a recycler view layout showing all items, with the ability to add, remove, and edit items. The user needed to be notified with a notification that an item was running low. The database needs to be password protected, with the capability to register a new user's login information. Finally, there needed to be a capability to enable and disable notifications within the application.
    
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
For this application to be functional and support the user's needs, I needed 4 screens, and a total of 10 layouts. Each of these screens needed a container and a fragment layout as well as two extra screens for the login displays. The UI designs kept the users in mind by including only the necessary information on each screen. This way navigation of the application is more intuitive with less clutter to be confused by. In addition, these screens maintained a simple layout and color scheme to remain appealing and clean to all users. These designs were successful because each button felt as if it had a purpose, and there was little redundnacy to be had within the application.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approaced the process of coding my app with a step-by-step procedure. I first started with a plan, then I created the UI, and finally I made the UI work and added the remaining features. During this time I tested as often as I could to ensure that my code was working after every addition. Each method had to work as intended before I moved on, otherwise the final product would become sloppy and unprofessional. This can be applied in the future while working in waterfall development, since this top-down approach would be well suited to ensuring everything is complete as we go.
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
For this application I learned how to properly use the debugger. This meant that with frequent testing I could pinpoint exactly where my values were misaligned, and hopefully understand exactly what is going on. This is an important process because I found out super quickly what was a logic error versus my own misunderstanding about how to use Java programming works. My Java programming grew exponentially with this application because there was a lot I had never encountered before.
    
    
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
My main point of innovation during this app was developing a class for comparison of the user's input for username and password to the database's stored usernames and passwords. This is one of the first Java classes I have ever written from scratch and it took quite a bit to perfect, however I overcame this with dedication and LOTS of research.
    
    
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I beleive I was most successful with the aformentioned comparison between the user's login to the database's logins. This was entirely my work and I am confident that it is done with the best of my knowledge at this point and time. It showcases many of the things I have learned about Java throughout the course.
